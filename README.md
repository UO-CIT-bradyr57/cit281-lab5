# Lab 5

## Purpose:
The purpose of this lab was to download Postman and use it to create and test different routes as they related to students and their id's. The lab required multiple routes to test if there were id's within the array, and to either add or delete them. 

## Technologies Learned:
```markdown
- Postman
- Fastify
- Node.js
```
## What I learned:
I learned how to use Postman, and the different features that it has. I created different routes and tested the output with Postman.
